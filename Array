*ARRAY
  An array store multiple items of the same type together -HOMOGENEOUS
  collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. 
  Array is index based starting from 0th index eg - 0,1,2,....n-1    
 
  DECLARING ARRAY WITH LENGTH  -  int a[] = new int[5];   have 5 index but no value 
  INITIALIZING ARRAY   -   int[] arr = {1, 2, 4, 5, 6};  have 5 values with 5 index 
 
  MUTABLE - CHANGE
  ARRAY IS MUTABLE IN JAVA 
 
*2D ARRAY -  array of array {
                            {},
                            {},
                            {}
                            }

row - horizontal 
col - vertical
int a[][] = new int[row][col];  we can define only row also .

- each nested array is a different object  ,so can be of different size .   eg  
      int arr[][] =       {
                            {1,2,3,4,5},
                            {7,8,9},
                            {99}
                          }
                            
0th index - {1,2,3,4,5},    eg- arr[0]
1th index - {7,8,9},        eg- arr[1]
2nd index - {99}            eg- arr[2]


NOTES Array.length gives number of rows eg arr.length() = 3

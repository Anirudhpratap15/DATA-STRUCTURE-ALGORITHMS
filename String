String: It is a sequence of characters. In java, objects of String are immutable which means a constant and cannot be changed once created.


 //String are  immuatable(cannot be changed)
        String a = "anirudh" ;
        String b = new String(a);

        //equal method check only char are same in string or not
        if(a.equals(b)){
            System.out.println("equals method");
            System.out.println("String is equals");                // output
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("not equals");
        }
// (==) compartor checks ref variable is pointing to the same object or not
        if(a==b){
            System.out.println(" == equals compartor method");
            System.out.println("String is equals");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("not equals");             // output
        }

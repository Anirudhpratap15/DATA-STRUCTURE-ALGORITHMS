In-place sorting algo -  Algorithm that does not need an extra space
Unstable - order is not maintain 

* Cycle sort is an in-place sorting Algorithm and  unstable 

   when element are given in range eg- 1 to n      ,  n = 5 ,
1) so the correct position for sorted element is  num-1  as index is started from 0  eg 0-4   when n= 5 .
   so the sorted arrays is      {1,2,3,4,5}
index-                       {0,1,2,3,4} 

eg- {3,5,2,1,4}
Algo - 
1 ) starting from 0th index check oth index element is at correct position if not then swap with correct index position 
              {3,5,2,1,4}   here 3  is not at correct index  should be on 2nd index    why ?  index = num-1  see point 1)
  
  after swap {2,5,3,1,4}  now swap 2 with 5         pass 1
              {5,2,3,1,4}  now swap 5 with 4        pass 2
              {4,2,3,1,5} now swap 4 with 1         pass 3
              {1,2,3,4,5}                           pass 4

2)  swap until get right element at each index then move next index 


complexity - there is 4 pass and n is 5 
    (n-1) swap needed  at worst case 
    this is worst case
    
    n+(n-1) = 2n+1  
    ignoring constant 
    complexity = (n)
